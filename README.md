# Kanban-Application
**Project Description:**
A Kanban Application can be defined as a software that provides visual workflow management that aids teams or any individual user to enhance efficiency by scheduling their tasks appropriately and adhering to their respective deadlines. In this project, I have built a Kanban Application that helps in creating lists and tasks along with their details about description and deadlines for the user to utilize and benefit from by adopting its usage in their day to day lives.
